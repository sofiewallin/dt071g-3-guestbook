# Guestbook C#

A console guest book application developed in C# and .NET. The application is part of a school assignment where I'm learning C#, .NET and object-oriented programming.

## About the application

It is a pure console application that starts out with a main view that has a menu of actions and the existing entries printed. The user can then choose to write an entry, remove an entry or exit program.

## Run the application

The application is built in with .NET 5.0 and you'll need .NET installed on your computer to run the application. Enter `dotnet run`in the console to run it.

In this repository the JSON-file (guestbook.json) where the guest book will be stored is not included but it will be added as soon as the first entry is written.
